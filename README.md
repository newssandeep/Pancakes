This recipe is a recipe for yummy pancakes to eat for breakfast
You can add things to the batter like blueberries, and strawberries, and bananas
You can also add toppings on top of the pancakes when they are done, like syrup and butter.
(Also I made this recipe up, so it is not a real recipe, so don't actually try it)
